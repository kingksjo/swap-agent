# Lowering the Complexity of DeX tools using AI

**Opening Statement:** Using decentralized technology is unnecessarily complicated, our goal is to make it simpler.

### The Problem: Web3's Adoption Crisis

Web3 holds the promise of a decentralized future, but its potential is being stifled by significant barriers to entry. Our survey of 940 respondents reveals a massive adoption gap: while 90% have heard of Web3, only 57% have ever used it. The data pinpoints the core issues: overwhelming complexity, a lack of knowledge on where to start, and deep-seated security and trust concerns . These roadblocks prevent a staggering amount of the population from engaging, leaving billions in potential value untapped.

### The Solution: An AI-Powered Web3 Assistant

Our product is a user-centric AI assistant designed to democratize Web3. It doesn't just automate; it **educates**, **safeguards**, and **simplifies** the user experience. By leveraging Conversational AI , the assistant acts as a bridge, transforming intimidating transactions into seamless, understandable interactions.

### Our Data-Driven Approach

We have identified and addressed the key pain points directly with our solution:

- **Complexity & Knowledge Gaps:** The AI provides step-by-step guidance and explains transactions in plain, simple language, resolving the "don't know where to start" and "too complicated" barriers. 63% of respondents desire this feature.

- **Personalized Experiences:**  In the future, our assistant is integrated with a user's on-chain behavior. By analyzing their transaction history, preferred tokens, and other actions, the AI can offer proactive, context-aware suggestions. For instance, if a user frequently swaps ETH for USDC on a specific protocol, the assistant can anticipate this action and streamline the process by offering quick transaction shortcuts, saving time and effort. This level of personalized, on-chain intelligence is what sets our assistant apart from being educated by other chatbots like ChatGPT. 
    
- **Security & Trust:** In the future the assistant will proactively scan for scams, risky contracts, and address errors, providing real-time warnings and building trust. This directly tackles the 19% of users with security fears. 61% of respondents want this feature. It is currently immune to prompt inject attacks with a well structured proxy service.
    
- **Fees & Utility:** It suggests cost-saving networks or optimal timing for transactions, making Web3 practical for daily use and addressing high fees (14%) and the perception of irrelevance (22%).
    

**The assistant is built for empowerment, not control; it has no access to a user's wallet, ensuring their assets remain secure.**

### Business Model: Empowering Platforms

Our business model is built on a freemium subscription model to attract a broad user base while monetizing our most valuable features. The free tier will allow users to interact with the AI assistant for educational purposes, asking questions and receiving plain-language explanations with some usage limits. The "Pro" subscription will unlock  action-based features like swapping and making transactions and, transaction cost optimization suggestions, and advanced address validation, providing the full suite of security and convenience tools that users demand. This model allows non-users to experience the value of the assistant risk-free, while providing a clear incentive to convert to a paid plan for a truly secure and optimized Web3 experience.

### Our Reach: Unlocking Billions in Value

Our survey data provides a resounding mandate: 89% of all respondents said an AI assistant would make them more likely to use Web3. Among non-users, this number rises to 88%, representing a massive opportunity to convert a hesitant audience into active participants. By lowering the barriers to entry for millions, we can accelerate mainstream adoption and unlock a new era of decentralized finance and digital ownership.

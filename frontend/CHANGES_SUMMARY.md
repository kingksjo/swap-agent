# Frontend UI Work Summary

Date: 2025-09-30
Scope: `frontend/`

## Goals
- Align the chat UI and landing page with the design.
- Persist input at the bottom while making only the messages area scrollable.
- Simplify the loading indicator.
- Improve text rendering (markdown) and landing page spacing/visual polish.

## Key Files Touched
- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/components/UnifiedMessage.tsx`
- `src/components/LandingPage.tsx`
- `src/index.css`



### 1) Make input persistent and only messages scroll
- `src/App.tsx`:
  - Initial attempt: changed outer container to `h-screen` and used `overflow-hidden` on `<main>` with a scrollable messages area (`overflow-y-auto`).
  - Added fixed input section separate from the scroll area.


### 2) Simplify loading indicator
- `src/App.tsx`:
  - Replaced large bordered card with a compact spinner-only inline indicator.


### 3) Assistant text rendering without chat bubbles
- `src/components/UnifiedMessage.tsx`:
  - Switched assistant messages from bubble containers to plain text rendering with markdown on dark background. Kept bubbles for user messages.




### 5) Scrollbar theming
- `src/index.css`:
  - Added dark scrollbar styling for Firefox and WebKit to blend with theme.




## Notes
- All changes were UI-only; no business logic or API behavior was altered.
